# Multi-Language Translator

## Goal

1. Common Languages Amongst Muslim Immigrants in North Amercia ---> Output to English Subtitles

## Purpose

### For the viewership

To provide a language-learning aid for any North American Shia who's a youth or otherwise predominantly English-speaking, to learn about
other Muslim cultures by understanding their language. Thus fulfilling the Qur'anic spirit of learning about all peoples and tribes, as we all come under the lordship of Allah (SWT).

### For the masjid

While most creators on YouTube split their videos amongst multiple channels on the basis on language (to perform better on the YouTube algorithm), multi-cultural masjids play by a different set of rules. To make an inclusive environment, all languages are welcome - but that means they need to be accessible to all audience members, in order to retain viewership (to do well in YouTube) and create a culture that draws upon its diversity to become even more united.
